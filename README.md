Use a Python script to sum times of check-in/check-out in Google Sheets

This is a short script for my CMPT395 (a school course) teammates to help them compile the time totals for a Google Sheet, which records the time of check-in and check-out on a timesheet.

Here's an example of the time sheet we have:

|Check in/out|Member1|Member2|Member3|Member4|Member5|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|in|00:00|11:30|12:30|&#65279;|16:50|
|out|2:00|14:30|14:30|&#65279;|13:00|
|in|7:30|20:00|20:00|&#65279;|17:00|
|out|10:00|21:00|22:00|&#65279;|18:30|
|in|19:00|15:00|&#65279;|&#65279;|23:00|
|out|21:15|15:30|&#65279;|&#65279;|02:00|

The script will read the values straight from the Google Sheets API and sum them for each member.

Optionally, it writes the sums for each column to the sheet like this, if you provide a cell range:
|Member1|10:00:00|
|---|---|
|Member2|20:00:00|
|Member3|15:00:00|

Also, I don't want to bother with spreadsheet equations. I'm a lazy (spent 7 hours on this) programmer.


If you're reading this, hey! This is an example of an "internal tool", or a tailor-made program used by the employees of an organization and not for the client.\
For example, your teachers' report card system, or their attendance sheets would be internal tools.\
Use `H10:I12` for the cell range when it prompts you to provide cells to write to.
