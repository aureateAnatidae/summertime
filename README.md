Use a Python script to sum times of check-in/check-out in Google Sheets

This is a short script for my CMPT395 teammates to help them compile the time totals for a Google Sheet, which records the time of check-in and check-out on a timesheet.

If you're reading this, hey! This is an example of an "internal tool", or a tailor-made program used by the employees of an organization and not for the client.
For example, your teachers' report card system, or their attendance sheets would be internal tools.
Use `H10:I12` for the cell range when it prompts you to provide cells to write to.
